title: 'Building a blog with astro'
description: >
  I recently rewrote my personal website using Astro, a meta-framework using the island architecture.
  The island architecture allows to combine static and dynamic components without typical overhead.

import { Image } from '@astrojs/image/components';

import blogImg from './alexander-milo-HwxVLhLyg2s-unsplash.jpg';
import figmaImg from './figma.png';

export const img = { src: blogImg, alt: 'A long trail in the mountains' };

I recently read a few books on design. Since my previous website design was not particularly good
([see for yourself](https://web.archive.org/web/20220731123004/https://vandevoorde.me/about/)),
I made the decision to create a new personal website.

## Design

I am a backend engineer by trade. I only know web technoligies (CSS/JS) up to a certain point.
Some past experiences have showed me that designing a website directly by coding is not an easy task.
I had to fight with CSS for every design ideas or improvements. The design iteration was pretty painful.

This time, I took another approach. I used [figma](https://www.figma.com/) to first have a rough idea of the design
of my new website before diving into the code. figma is a WYSIWYG design tool primarly used by designers to create
mockups and prototypes. You can create boxes, texts, shapes, ... and easily drag-and-drop, edit, color them at your
liking. Compared to the code-first approach, the design iteration was much faster.

In the end, I had a few figma components and two pages ([link to the figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/iAbP3wpiyUyv8XmP5Cdtru/personal-website-v2?node-id=0%3A1)).

<figure>
  <Image src={figmaImg} alt='A screenshot of my figma project' format='webp' />
  <figcaption>A screenshot of the latest version of my figma project</figcaption>
</figure>

The figma project is no longer kept up-to-date. There are a few differences between the screenshot above
and the current version of this website. This is on purpose. The figma mockups were only supposed to
help me with the initial design. If ever I want to change a feature on the website with a new design, I might
re-open the project again.

## Code

It's time to build! My previous website was using [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static site generator built on
top of [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). gatsby is a really cool project but I wanted
to change. gatsby has been around for more than 7 years now. In Javascript world, that's a long time. So, I wanted to see if
there was something better created in the meantime. And, to be honest, for a side project, I just like to test the new shiny
techno.

### Framework selection

I defined a few requirements for the framework selection:

- Best-in-class developer experience
- First-class Markdown support
- Generate lightweight static pages
- Flexible

Heading over [jamstack.org static generator ranking](https://jamstack.org/generators/), I stumbled onto
[Astro](https://jamstack.org/generators/astro/):

> Astro is a fresh but familiar approach to building websites.
  Astro combines decades of proven performance best practices with the DX improvements of the
  component-oriented era. Use your favorite JavaScript framework and automatically ship the bare-minimum
  amount of JavaScriptâ€”by default.

Sounds interesting!
